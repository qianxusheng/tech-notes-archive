## Relational Database
Centrialized structure, one major data center storing all the data. (TOO much join is so bad.)

## Transaction

A transaction meets the principle of ACID:

- **A** represents **Atomicity**, which means all operations in the transaction will either all succeed or fail.
- **C** represents **Consistency**, which means the database will transition from one valid state to another during the transaction.
- **I** represents **Isolation**, which ensures that transactions won't affect each other, avoiding concurrency problems.
- **D** represents **Durability**, which means that after the transaction, the changes are permanent in the database, even if the system crashes.

A Database Management System (DBMS) provides different **isolation levels**, allowing us to make trade-offs between **performance** and **consistency**.

## InnoDB engine infrastructure
**Core functionality**: Data storage(tablespaces, .idb files); transaction and log management(redo and undo log); lock and concurrent control; memory management;  

**In-memory structure**:
- Buffer Pool: A memory area that caches frequently accessed data pages to reduce disk I/O operations. It uses data structures like linked lists and applies the LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm to manage page replacement efficiently.  
- Change Buffer: Specifically for secondary index updates (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). Instead of immediately updating the index on disk, the changes are first buffered. When the index is later accessed via a SELECT operation, the changes are merged and then written to disk, further reducing disk I/O operations.  

**On-disk structure**:  
- Tablespaces: idb files; a database is divided into logical storage units;  
- Double write buffer: prevent a partial write; if system crashed, the buffer can write again, then write into the .idb file;

## Dependency

Dependency refers to the relationship between different columns in a database.

## Normalization

Normalization involves the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and dependency. There are different normal forms:

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Every column must contain atomic values, meaning a column shouldn't have multiple values.
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Create foreign keys to eliminate duplicate values in each row.
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Every column in the table should only depend on the primary key, not any other column in the table.
- **3.5NF**, **4NF**, **5NF**: More advanced normalization forms, but typically **3NF** is sufficient.

## Index

Using **indexes** helps speed up searching by utilizing binary search. Typical indexes include:

- **Unique index**
- **Full-text index**
- **Primary index**
- **Index**

The underlying data structures for indexes are usually **B+ tree** and **hashmap**, which represent **ordered_map** and **unordered_map**, respectively.

## Stored Procedures and Functions

Stored procedures and functions are almost the same, but stored procedures usually handle transactions.

## Triggers

Triggers are often used with stored procedures or functions, such as updating the count in a table when a user data is inserted successfully.

## Locking

- **Table-level locks**
- **Row-level locks**

These mechanisms deal with concurrent transactions.

## Temporary Tables

Temporary tables are usually used in transactions. They are joined once and can be accessed multiple times during the transaction.

## Views

A **view** is not a real table; it's a way to reuse logic. However, it will still run all the queries underneath when accessed.

## SQL Basics

- **Join**
- **Aggregation**
- **Control flow**
- **IN predicate**
- **Subquery**

## Relational Algebra

Relational algebra is an abstract query language focused on the logic. Itâ€™s useful for speeding up query performance by reducing unnecessary operations. For example, **A and not A** is always true.

## Backup

Backup is used for restoring data if needed at a later time.

## Recovery

Recovery refers to restoring data from a backup node.

## NoSQL Database
Distributed system, scalability, high-performance, redundancy.

### BASE

NoSQL databases follow the **BASE** model:

- **Basically Available**: The database is available for all users, but there is no isolation.
- **Soft State**: Since it's a distributed system, changes in one node need time to propagate to other nodes.
- **Eventually Consistent**: The system will eventually reach consistency over time.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a **document database**. The structure of a Java object is very similar to JSON, which makes it easy to deserialize and serialize data in a document database.

### Neo4J

Neo4J is a **graph database**.
